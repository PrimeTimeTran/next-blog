# Why did you leave?

1. **Acknowledges reality** — sometimes things don’t work out
2. **Shows self-awareness** — you take responsibility when it’s your fault
3. **Doesn’t blame anyone** — you don’t want to come off as negative or defensive
4. **Highlights learning / growth** — you focus on progress, not just “failures”

## **1. Frame it as a natural part of career growth**

You can start by normalizing the idea that not every job is a perfect fit:

> “Over my career, I’ve had experiences that worked out really well and others that
> taught me a lot even if the fit wasn’t perfect. I see every role as an opportunity
> to learn, and I’ve learned a lot about what environments and challenges help me thrive.”

This **acknowledges some things didn’t work out** without saying it was anyone’s “fault.”

---

## **2. Take personal responsibility tactfully**

You want to admit mistakes without being self-deprecating:

> “Some of the transitions were my own decision,
> often because I realized I could grow faster or take
> on challenges that were a better match for my skills.”

This subtly says, “I’m reflective, I know myself, and I try to make thoughtful career decisions.”

## **3. Attribute part to external factors neutrally**

If there were circumstances beyond your control, you can mention them **without blaming**:

> “Other changes happened as companies evolved —
> sometimes roles shifted or priorities changed.
> I focus on adapting and learning from each experience.”

This shows awareness of **context** without sounding like you’re passing the buck.

---

## **4. Emphasize growth and future orientation**

Always end on **what you learned and how it shapes your next role**:

> “The key takeaway for me is that hitting a home run often requires a mix of skill, fit, and
> sometimes timing — things that are not entirely in anyone’s control. I’ve learned how to maximize
> my impact, and I’m excited to bring that perspective to a long-term role here.”

### ✅ **Why this works**

- It **acknowledges luck**: you hint that success is not always just hard work.
- It **balances responsibility**: some things were your choices, some were situational.
- It **avoids negativity**: no finger-pointing.
- It **projects professionalism and self-awareness**, which is exactly what employers are trying to gauge when they ask about past roles.
