# ✅ **Major Sections in Calculus I (University Level)**

## **1. Pre-Calculus Foundations (usually the first quiz/test)**

You _do_ get tested on these even though they’re “review”:

- Algebra manipulation
- Functions & graphs
- Exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric functions
- Piecewise functions
- Basic inequalities
- Difference quotient: (\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h})

---

## **2. Limits**

This is usually Test 1.

- Limit laws
- One-sided limits
- Limits at infinity
- Infinite limits (vertical asymptotes)
- Continuity
- Formal definition: (\varepsilon)-(\delta) (rarely heavily tested, depends on the school)
- Special trig limits
  [
  \lim_{x\to0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1,\quad \lim_{x\to0} \frac{1-\cos x}{x} = 0
  ]

---

## **3. Derivatives**

This is the **largest** chunk of the course.

### **Definition of the derivative**

- From first principles:
  [
  f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
  ]
- Tangent lines, instantaneous rate of change

### **Rules of differentiation**

- Power rule
- Product rule
- Quotient rule
- Chain rule
- Higher-order derivatives
- Derivatives of:

  - Exponential functions
  - Logarithms
  - Trigonometric functions
  - Inverse trigonometric functions

### **Applications of derivatives**

This is often its own test.

- Related rates
- Linear approximation & differentials
- Increasing/decreasing functions
- Concavity & inflection points
- Optimization problems
- Curve sketching
- Mean Value Theorem / Rolle’s Theorem

---

## **4. Integrals**

Usually the last 2–3 weeks + the final exam.

### **Antiderivatives**

- Basic indefinite integrals
- Substitution (u-sub)

### **Definite integrals**

- Riemann sums
- The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC I & II)
- Area under curves
- Average value of a function

If the school goes further (some Calc I courses do):

- Volumes by slicing / washers (sometimes in Calc II instead)

# ⭐ **Complete List (What a Calc I Final Covers)**

Most final exams cover:

1. **Limits**
2. **Continuity**
3. **Derivative definition**
4. **Derivative rules**
5. **Derivative applications**
6. **Graphing with derivatives**
7. **Optimization**
8. **Related rates**
9. **Definite & indefinite integrals**
10. **FTC & substitution**

---

# 🧭 **Are you missing anything?**

The only major thing students forget that’s definitely tested:

### **• The Mean Value Theorem (MVT)**

### **• L’Hôpital’s Rule** (sometimes in Calc I, sometimes Calc II depending on the university)
