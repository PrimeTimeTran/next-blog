## Cheat Sheet

- Binary Search
  - Max, min, least, most, smallest, largest...
  - “Is this enough?”
  - “Is X sufficient / feasible?”
  - Guess an answer and verify it with a monotonic yes/no predicate.
  - Problems where feasibility improves monotonically as the answer grows or shrinks.
- Greedy
  - earliest, latest, closest, "as soon as possible", "locally optimal", "minimum number of, maximum number of"
  - Irreversible
  - No backtracking
  - Once I decide, I never regret it
  - “Take it now.”
- DP
  - Max, min, least, most, smallest, largest...
  - “Try all valid choices and remember the best.”
  - “What is the best answer using the first i elements?”
  - "number of ways", "all possible", "optimal substructure", "choose / don’t choose", "maximum profit, minimum cost"
  - You construct the solution
  - No guessing

## One Liner

Binary Search → guess & verify (monotonic)
Greedy → decide once, move on
DP → explore choices, remember results
