- Foundations

  - Big-O / Time & Space Complexity
  - Basic math (modular arithmetic, combinatorics) and problem patterns

- Arrays & Strings

  - Two Pointers
  - ## Sliding Window
  - Prefix / Suffix techniques

- Hashing

- Searching & Sorting

  - Binary Search (and variants)

    - Concepts:
      - Family A: Membership (hit-and-exit) binary search
        - l <= r
        - nums[m] == target? Exit
      - Family B: Boundary / candidate-elimination binary search
        - l < r
        - l & r pointers converge to a single index.
