1. Understand
“This solution uses Union-Find grouped by time, temporarily connecting participants at each timestamp and rolling back connections that don’t lead to secret propagation.”

Correct strategy (high-level)
Sort meetings by time
Process meetings grouped by the same time
For each time group:
- Union all participants in that time
- Check which connected components contain someone who knows the secret
- Only keep those unions
- Reset the rest
This preserves simultaneity correctly.
