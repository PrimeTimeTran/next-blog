Max Flow examples (Edmonds-Karp)

Notes:
- Edmonds-Karp is an implementation of Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find the shortest augmenting path.
- Time complexity: O(V * E^2) in worst case for Edmonds-Karp; Dinic is faster in practice.
- Use this implementation to experiment with small flow graphs and min-cut extraction.
