1. Understand
Two-pointer sweep over two sorted interval lists.

At each step, compare one interval from each list:
- Compute their intersection, if it exists
- Move forward the pointer of the interval that ends first,
  since it cannot overlap with any future interval.

This efficiently exhausts both lists while collecting all intersections.

5. Big O
Time:   O(n + m)
Space:  O(1) extra (excluding output)
