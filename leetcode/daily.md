- LinkedList
  - Ensure partition of list is even and slow pointer is at node BEFORE partition
    while at the same time avoiding loops with f.next and f.next.next
  - Reference/Mutation is important when we consider
  - LRUCache
    - Utilizes
      - Doubly linked list, cache,
    - Define ListNode with key, val, left, right
    - Define, insert, remove methods.
    - Insert:
    - Get:
      - If key in cache, remove it and then add it again(to update cache)
- Stocks/DP
  - Recursion lets us shrink the problem space on
    - Days
    - Buy or Sell
    - Open or Close
    - Cooldown present
    - Number of transactions remaining
- Binary Search
  - Key Concepts:
    - Concerned with ordered decisions
    - Binary search is a method for finding a boundary in a monotonic search space by
      maintaining invariants and discarding half the candidates at each step.
  - Preconditions:
    - Search space must be ordered
      - Sorted array or
      - Implicitly ordered answer space (values, capacities, thresholds)
    - Discrete search space
      - Indices, integers, or values that can be totally ordered
  - Invariants:
    - Define what is always true about l and r
    - Tell us which half can be discarded safely
    - l = last known invalid
    - r = first known valid
    - Binary search is fundamentally about maintaining invariants, not about “cutting arrays in half”.
  - Midpoint Choice
    - Left Lean
      - m = (l + r) // 2
    - Right Lean
      - m = (l + r + 1) // 2
    - Used to:
      - Avoid infinite loops
      - Ensure progress when l or r moves to m
  - Update Rules
    - Use m ± 1 only when m itself is known to be invalid or valid
    - Use r = m or l = m when:
      - You are preserving a boundary
      - m could still be the answer
  - Dont return a specific index, but a in
  - Monotonic structure
    - Can be used to ensure we...
  - Termination Patterns (very important)
    - Find a specific value
      - while l <= r
      - Return index or -1
    - Find a boundary / minimum feasible value
      - while l < r
      - Return l or r (they converge)
    - Two-sided invariant boundary
      - while l + 1 < r
      - Return r (or l, depending on invariant)
    - The loop condition is determined by what you want to return.
  - Binary Search on Answer (Big one)
    - Binary search does not require an array
      - Search space can be:
        - Maximum allowed value
        - Minimum capacity
        - Time, speed, cost, sum, distance
      - Requires:
        - A check / predicate function
        - Monotonicity of that predicate
  - Monotonic Structure (This is the keystone)
    - Once a condition becomes true, it never becomes false again
    - Benefits:
      - 1️⃣ Enables logarithmic search
        - ✅ O(log n)
        - ⛔️ O(n)
      - 2️⃣ Makes “checking” cheaper than “solving”
      - 3️⃣ Separates logic cleanly
        - Outer loop → search
        - Inner function → correctness check
      - 4️⃣ Guarantees correctness via invariants
        - When you discard half the space,
        - You never discard the answer
