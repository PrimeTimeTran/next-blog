- Backtracking
  - Concepts:
    - Recursion
    - State
    - Builds candidates & abandons when determined to not fit constraints
- LinkedList
  - Ensure partition of list is even and slow pointer is at node BEFORE partition
    while at the same time avoiding loops with f.next and f.next.next
  - Reference/Mutation is important when we consider
  - LRUCache
    - Utilizes
      - Doubly linked list, cache,
    - Define ListNode with key, val, left, right
    - Define, insert, remove methods.
    - Insert:
    - Get:
      - If key in cache, remove it and then add it again(to update cache)
- Stocks/DP
  - Recursion lets us shrink the problem space on
    - Days
    - Buy or Sell
    - Open or Close
    - Cooldown present
    - Number of transactions remaining
- Binary Search
  - Invariant Structure
  - Left/Right Leaning midpoint
- Greedy
  - Greedy Property
- Trees
  - Recursion:
    - Base Cases
  - Including Nodes vs Edges:
    - 1 + max(l, r)
    - 1 + l + r
  - Traversals:
    - Preorder
    - Inorder
    - Postorder
- DP
  - Base Cases
    - Reducing problem space until base case reached
  - Memoization
  - Tabulation
  - Rolling
- Stocks
- Trees
- Greedy
  - Locally Optimal Choices:
    - At each step, the algorithm chooses the option that offers the most apparent and immediate benefit, without considering the long-term consequences of that decision.
  - Irreversible Decisions:
    - Once a choice is made, the algorithm never reconsiders it or backtracks to a previous state, which distinguishes it from other methods like dynamic programming.
  - Efficiency:
    - Greedy algorithms are often simpler to implement and are generally more efficient in terms of time complexity (e.g., O(n log n) or O(n)).
  - Not Always Optimal:
    - The key limitation is that a locally optimal choice does not always lead to a globally optimal solution for every problem. The algorithm works best for problems exhibiting two specific properties:
  - Greedy Choice Property:
    - A global optimum can be reached by making a local optimum choice at each step.
  - Optimal Substructure:
    - An optimal solution to the entire problem contains optimal solutions to its sub-problems.
