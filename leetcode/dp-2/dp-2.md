## ✅ Phase 1: Entry-Level 2D DP (must do)

These introduce the idea of `dp[i][j]` without overwhelming you.

## ✅ Phase 4: Interval / Range DP (harder, but critical)

Do _at least one or two_ from here.

- **486. Predict the Winner**

## ✅ Phase 5: Advanced 2D DP (optional but powerful)

Only touch these after Phase 2–3 feel okay.

- **72. Edit Distance**
  [https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance)

- **221. Maximal Square**
  [https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square)

## 🔑 How to study these (this matters more than the list)

For **each problem**, force yourself to answer _before coding_:

1. What does `dp[i][j]` _mean in English_?
2. What choice am I making at `(i, j)`?
3. Which base cases represent success vs failure?
4. Does this feel like:

   - matching?
   - movement?
   - interval shrinking?

If you can’t answer #1 clearly → stop and don’t code yet.

## ✅ Phase 6: Top Right Final Result

"Top Right"

1. Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS)
2. Longest Palindromic Substring (expand DP version, not center-expand)
3. Minimum Deletions to Make a Palindrome
4. Minimum Insertions to Make a Palindrome
5. Burst Balloons (hard DP)
6. Optimal Binary Search Tree / Matrix Chain Multiplication / Interval DP problems
