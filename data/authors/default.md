# Loi Tran is professional, developer, and architect

I build beautifully crafted webpages 💻 and mobile 📱 apps.

I'm an [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://www.credly.com/badges/c6fa2310-f2ec-4bf3-a43b-0009a3718ef0).

Over the course of my career I've worked in [booking/ticketing](https://vexere.com/), [telemedicine for medical imagining](https://scanlabmr.com/), and [education](https://www.coderschool.vn/en).

In this time I've become proficient with the following languages, tools, and technologies.

HTML, CSS, JS, ES6, Ruby, Python, Dart, Java, Go,

Material, Bootstrap, Vuetify, Tailwind, SCSS, SASS, LESS,

SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Sequelize, Mongoose, ActiveRecord, GraphQL, GRPC, Bash, Git, Docker,

Ruby on Rails, Node, React, Vue, React Native, Flutter, Gatsby, Next, Jekyll, WordPress,

The proudest moment in my professional career was working with Facebook to teach hundreds of students mobile
development with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) in their [developer circles program](https://developers.facebook.com/developercircles/).

When I'm not working I enjoy American 🇺🇸 Football 🏈, Kung Fu 🥋, discussions on philosophy/politics 🤔 and contemplating the meaning of life.
