The proudest moment in my professional career was working with Facebook at
[CoderSchool](https://www.coderschool.vn/en) to teach hundreds of students mobile
development with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) in their
[developer circles program](https://developers.facebook.com/developercircles/).
