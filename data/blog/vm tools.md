## UTM

[UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) is tool for running VMs on ARM64 architecture
and more.

I need a windows machine to run .NET Framework(which only runs on Windows).

Although I do have a windows machine I decided to install Windows on my M1 laptop
because I don't want to have to carry around multiple machines in the future.

I'm writing this post because although these are many other tools for installing
VMs available, this seemed to be the easiest one for ARM64 architecture;
at least for now.

It's been awesome, I was able to setup a Windows & Kali machine in about 2 hours(including
download times.)

I decided to go ahead and install Kali too to practice my infosec skills
as well since I was already in the neighborhood.
