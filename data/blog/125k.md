## How I got an offer for $125,000 a year with no computer science degree

I got a job offer for $125,000/year as someone without a CS degree.

Below are the steps I took to achieve that.

I want to **encourage** others who aren't in a position to go back to school
like me so I'm sharing to give a realistic idea of what it takes.

Not only do we have to spend years, but we have to learn _dozens_ of different technologies
and skills.

- Attended a class at [CoderSchool](https://coderschool.vn/) in 2016 where I
  learned Ruby on Rails.
- Worked on a startup idea I had for about a year which eventually failed.
  Although it failed, I learned a lot including but not limited to:

  - Archive and upload apps to App/Play stores.
  - Create an iOS/Android distribution provisioning profile and distribution certificates.
  - How to build mobile apps with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

    - Components - Independent reusable pieces of UI.
    - Props - A way to make reusable code behave dynamically.
    - State - A technique for making the UI “reflect reality”. The UI "reacts" to state changes(sign in vs sign out).
    - Navigation - A way to organize screens and move back and forth between them.
      - Stacks which we add and pop from a list.
      - Tabs for different pages we want to organize visa tab displays.
      - Drawers for side content which we want to scroll in from the side.

    - How to localize apps language using [i18n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-i18n).
    - How to use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for global state management.

  - Create a REST API with [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).
    - Define routes which provide unique data at different controller endpoints.
    - Version the API so we can push new changes without breaking old behavior.
    - How polymorphism allows us to get multiple resources to respond to a shared method.
    - How to share code between entities using inheritance such that the code is
      more manageable/maintainable/organized.
    - Modeled relationships between resources/tables on the server using an ORM(Active Record).
      - One to one relationships.
      - One to many relationships.
      - Many to many relationships.
  - How to ensure consistent code style using tools like rubocop(commit hooks which run linters).
  - How to deploy to an [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/?trk=36c6da98-7b20-48fa-8225-4784bced9843&sc_channel=ps&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!467723097970!e!!g!!aws%20ec2&ef_id=CjwKCAiA85efBhBbEiwAD7oLQIDvHU0jYVpArJ1_WM-Wk4t2YjDvnsb_N34LSb0ewjCpnXWg65puSBoCilMQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!467723097970!e!!g!!aws%20ec2) instance using [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano).
  - How to debug complicated code using debuggers like [Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry).

- Worked at CoderSchool for a few years teaching:

  - React
  - React Native
  - NodeJS
  - Python/Flask

- Worked at [1on1English](https://thelearningos.com/) as a mobile lead:

  - Ensured we delivered out mobile app on time and below budget.
  - Worked with cross functional teams to understand user pain points and to
    suggest alternative solutions or plan how to deliver requirements.

- Worked as a Full Stack Developer at [ScanlabMR](https://scanlabmr.com/):

  - VueJS - A framework for building web user interfaces.
  - NodeJS - Cross platform server environment running on V8 engine allowing us
    to execute JS outside the browser.
  - PostgreSQL - A powerful, open source object-relational database system with
    over 35 years of active development.
