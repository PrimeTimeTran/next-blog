-

```sql
select teacher_id, count(distinct subject_id) as cnt
from teacher
group by teacher_id
```

- Using group by without an aggregate function produces indeterminate values for columns which aren't properly handled using an aggregate funciton.

```sql
select *
from teacher
group by teacher_id
```
