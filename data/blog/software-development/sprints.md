| Area to Define               | Description                                                                                 | Typical Options / Considerations                        | Choice                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Sprint Length**            | Duration of each iteration. Should balance fast feedback with enough time to deliver value. | 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks (most common: 2 weeks)              | 2 weeks                   |
| **Definition of Done (DoD)** | Clear criteria for when work is considered complete.                                        | Code complete, tested, documented, deployed, etc.       | Code deployed             |
| **Team Roles**               | Decide who will act as Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team members.           | May overlap initially, but should be explicit.          | Many Hats                 |

| **Estimation Method**        | How effort/complexity is estimated.                                                         | Story points, T-shirt sizes, ideal hours, no-estimates  | Story Points              |
| **Meeting Cadence**          | When and how often recurring events happen.                                                 | Daily stand-up (15 min), sprint review, retrospective   | Msg in Chat               |
| **Tools & Boards**           | Tools to track work and progress.                                                           | Jira, Trello, Azure DevOps, physical boards, etc.       | Github Projects           |
| **Communication Norms**      | How team members collaborate and share updates.                                             | Daily scrum, Slack/Teams, async updates                 | Slack                     |
| **Retrospective Practices**  | How continuous improvement is approached.                                                   | Action items, experiments, feedback cycles              | TBD                       |
| **Release Strategy**         | How often increments are deployed/released to users.                                        | End of each sprint, continuous deployment, on-demand    | TBD                       |
| **Metrics & Tracking**       | What to measure to understand progress and improve.                                         | Velocity, burndown charts, lead time, cycle time        | TBD                       |
