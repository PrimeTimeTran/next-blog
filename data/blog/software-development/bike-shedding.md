# Introduction

"Bike shedding" refers to the tendency of people to spend excessive time discussing or focusing on trivial details while neglecting more important, complex issues. The term comes from "Parkinson's Law of Triviality," which illustrates how a committee might spend more time debating the color of a bike shed than on the design of a nuclear power plant.

# Origin of the Term

The concept was popularized by C. Northcote Parkinson in 1957. He observed that people often feel more comfortable contributing to simple topics, even if those topics are not critical to the project's success.

# Examples in Software Development

- Debating code formatting styles instead of solving architectural problems.
- Spending meetings on naming conventions while ignoring system scalability.
- Arguing over minor UI details when core functionality is incomplete.

# Why Does Bike Shedding Happen?

People gravitate toward topics they understand and feel confident discussing. Complex issues may seem intimidating, so teams unconsciously shift focus to simpler, less impactful decisions.

# How to Avoid Bike Shedding

- Set clear agendas for meetings and stick to them.
- Prioritize decisions based on impact and importance.
- Encourage team members to focus on solving the most critical problems first.

# Conclusion

Recognizing bike shedding is the first step to improving team productivity. By focusing on what truly matters, software teams can deliver better results and avoid wasting time on the trivial.
