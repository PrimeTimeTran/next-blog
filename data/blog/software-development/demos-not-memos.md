# Introduction

In software development, clear communication is essential. The phrase "demos not memos" encourages teams to use demonstrations—such as working prototypes, screen recordings, or live walkthroughs—instead of lengthy written explanations when sharing ideas, reporting bugs, or giving feedback.

# Why Demos Work Better

Written memos can be misunderstood, lack context, or fail to convey the real user experience. Demos, on the other hand, make issues and solutions tangible. They help teammates see exactly what you mean, reducing confusion and speeding up problem-solving.

# Examples of Demos in Action

- **Feature Requests:** Instead of describing a new feature, show a quick prototype or mockup.
- **Bug Reports:** Record your screen to capture the bug in action, making it easier for others to reproduce and fix.
- **Feedback:** Walk through the app and point out areas for improvement in real time.

# Benefits for Teams

- Faster understanding and alignment
- Less back-and-forth clarification
- More actionable feedback
- Stronger collaboration

# How to Use Demos Effectively

- Use tools like Loom, Zoom, or built-in screen recorders to capture your workflow.
- Share links to working prototypes or staging environments.
- Keep demos short and focused on the main point.

# Conclusion

"Demos not memos" is a simple shift that can dramatically improve communication and productivity in software teams. Whenever possible, show your teammates what you mean—don’t just tell them.
