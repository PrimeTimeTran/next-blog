# Introduction

Net Asset Value (NAV) is a key financial metric used to determine the value of an entity's assets minus its liabilities. It is most commonly used in the context of investment funds, such as mutual funds and ETFs, to represent the per-share value of the fund.

# What is Net Asset Value?

NAV provides investors with a snapshot of the fund's value at a specific point in time. It helps investors understand how much each share of the fund is worth based on the underlying assets and liabilities.

# How is NAV Calculated?

The basic formula for calculating NAV is:

**NAV = (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) / Number of Outstanding Shares**

- **Total Assets**: The market value of all securities, cash, and other holdings owned by the fund.
- **Total Liabilities**: Any debts, expenses, or obligations the fund owes.
- **Number of Outstanding Shares**: The total number of shares issued to investors.

For example, if a fund has $10 million in assets, $1 million in liabilities, and 900,000 shares outstanding:

NAV = ($10,000,000 - $1,000,000) / 900,000 = $10 per share

# Why is NAV Important?

NAV is used to price transactions in and out of the fund. When you buy or sell shares, the NAV determines the price you pay or receive. It also helps track the fund's performance over time.

# Conclusion

Net Asset Value is a simple yet powerful concept that helps investors understand the true value of their investments in funds. By regularly calculating and monitoring NAV, investors can make informed decisions and assess the health of their portfolios.
