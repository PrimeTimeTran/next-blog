# Introduction

Futures are one of the most important and widely used derivatives in financial markets. Whether you're a hedger protecting against price moves, a speculator seeking directional exposure, or an investor interested in commodity or index exposure, futures contracts provide a standardized, liquid mechanism to trade future delivery of an asset.

This post gives a practical, non-technical introduction to futures: what a futures contract is, essential terms to know, a simple example, common use cases, and the main risks.

## What is a futures contract?

A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Contracts are standardized (size, expiration, delivery specifications) and traded on regulated exchanges (for example, CME, ICE).

Key characteristics:

- Standardized terms (contract size, tick value, expiration dates)
- Traded on exchanges with a clearinghouse that guarantees performance
- Margin-based: traders post and maintain margin rather than paying the full notional price up front
- Settled either by physical delivery (less common for many traders) or cash settlement

## Important terms

- Notional / Contract Size: the quantity of the underlying represented by one contract (e.g., 100 barrels, 50 An index multiplier)
- Tick and Tick Value: the minimum price increment and its monetary value per contract
- Expiration / Delivery Date: when the contract settles or is rolled
- Initial Margin / Maintenance Margin: collateral required to open and maintain a position
- Mark to Market: daily settlement of gains and losses, with margin calls if the balance falls below maintenance
- Long vs Short: long commits to buy the underlying in the future (benefits from price rises); short commits to sell in the future (benefits from price falls)

## A simple example

Imagine a wheat farmer worried about prices falling before harvest. The farmer can sell (go short) wheat futures today at a fixed price. If spot prices fall before harvest, the loss in the cash market is offset by gains in the futures position. Conversely, a bakery expecting to buy wheat can go long futures to lock in future input costs.

Example numbers (simplified):

- Current futures price for December wheat: $700 per contract (represents 100 bushels)
- Farmer sells 10 contracts (lock in $700 _ 100 _ 10)
- If price falls to $650 at harvest, the farmer's futures position gains $50 per bushel (offsetting lower spot revenue)

## Common uses

- Hedging: producers and consumers manage price risk (agriculture, energy, metals)
- Speculation: traders attempt to profit from directional moves using leverage
- Arbitrage and basis trading: exploit price differences between spot and futures or between expirations
- Exposure and portfolio management: investors gain or reduce exposure to commodity or index moves

## Advantages

- Liquidity and transparency on major contracts
- Standardization simplifies trading and settlement
- Leverage: small capital outlay controls a larger notional exposure (efficiency)
- Daily marking to market reduces credit risk between counterparties via the clearinghouse

## Risks and pitfalls

- Leverage magnifies losses as well as gains — margin calls can force positions to close at unfavourable prices
- Basis risk: the futures price may not perfectly track the underlying physical price
- Rollover/contango/backwardation: when holding futures across expirations, costs or gains of rolling can affect returns
- Settlement/expiry mechanics: futures close to expiration may behave differently (lower liquidity, delivery risk)
- Operational risk: incorrect sizing, insufficient margin, or poor execution can lead to large losses

## Practical tips for beginners

- Learn contract specifications (size, tick, margin) before trading a contract
- Use position sizing and strict risk management — treat leverage with respect
- Practice with simulation or small positions first
- Understand how and when to roll contracts if you intend to maintain exposure across expiries

## Conclusion

Futures are powerful tools for managing risk and gaining exposure to assets efficiently. Their standardization and exchange clearing make them accessible and safe relative to many over-the-counter derivatives, but leverage and market mechanics require discipline and understanding.

If you're starting out, focus on learning contract specifications, how margin works, and a clear plan for risk management. With those foundations, futures can be a practical part of hedging or trading strategies.
