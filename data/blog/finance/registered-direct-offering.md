# Introduction

A **registered direct offering (RDO)** is a way for a public company to raise capital by selling newly registered shares directly to a limited group of institutional investors. It blends features of public registration (shares are SEC-registered and freely tradable) with the speed and selectivity of a private placement.

This post explains how RDOs work, how they differ from an IPO, when companies choose them, and what investors should watch for.

# What is an RDO?

- The company registers the securities with the SEC so purchaser can trade them immediately.
- Sales are made directly to selected institutional buyers or through a placement agent, not via a broad public underwriting process.
- There is typically no underwriting syndicate guaranteeing the deal — pricing is negotiated with buyers.

# How an RDO differs from an IPO

- Registration vs. Distribution
  - Both involve SEC registration, but an IPO is a marketed, underwritten public launch; an RDO is a targeted sale after registration.
- Marketing and Roadshow
  - IPOs use roadshows and broad marketing to build retail and institutional demand. RDOs use private outreach to a few institutions.
- Underwriting and Guarantees
  - IPOs often have underwriters who stabilize and guarantee portions of the deal. RDOs rarely include firm underwriting commitments.
- Speed and Cost
  - RDOs are faster and cheaper to execute because they avoid the full IPO marketing cycle and underwriting fees.
- Pricing and Size
  - IPO pricing is set through bookbuilding with broad investor participation. RDO price is negotiated with the buyer(s) and may reflect discounts or premiums depending on demand.
- Dilution and Lockups
  - IPOs commonly include lockups for insiders; RDOs may have fewer or no lockup arrangements for the newly issued shares.
- Use Cases
  - IPOs are for primary public listing or large capital raises with broad distribution. RDOs are for quick, targeted capital needs by already-public companies.

# When companies choose an RDO

- They need capital quickly without market-wide marketing.
- Market conditions make a full IPO unattractive or too slow.
- They prefer to work with a small set of institutional buyers.
- To minimize fees and time compared with an underwritten offering.

# What investors should know

- Access: RDOs often go to institutional investors; retail access is rare.
- Liquidity: Shares are tradable immediately, but market liquidity depends on the float and interest.
- Pricing: Negotiated pricing may include discounts; understand why the buyer accepted the terms.
- Due diligence: Treat RDO allocations like any other investment — evaluate company fundamentals and use of proceeds.
- Disclosure: Registered status means the offering has SEC disclosure, but the distribution process is private.

# Practical example (brief)

A public biotech firm needs $30M to advance trials. Instead of an IPO, it registers shares and sells them directly to two investment funds at an agreed price. The deal closes in weeks, providing immediate funding with lower fees than a full public offering.

# Conclusion

RDOs are a pragmatic tool for public companies that need speed, flexibility, and targeted capital. They are not a substitute for an IPO when broad market access and liquidity are the goals, but they provide an efficient alternative in many situations. For investors, RDOs offer immediate tradability with institutional negotiation dynamics — evaluate price, purpose of proceeds, and potential impact on the company's float before deciding.
