# Introduction

In finance and economics, **indicators** are statistics or
data points used to analyze current conditions or predict future trends.

They’re generally grouped into two main types: **leading indicators** and **lagging indicators**.

### 🔹 Leading Indicators

These move **ahead of the economy or markets**, helping forecast future movements.
They’re **predictive** — useful for anticipating what _might happen next_.

**Examples:**

- **Stock Market Performance** – Often moves before the economy improves or worsens.
- **Bond Yield Curve (esp. inverted curve)** – Can signal upcoming recessions.
- **Building Permits / Housing Starts** – Construction plans show confidence in future demand.
- **Manufacturing Orders (PMI)** – More orders suggest growth ahead.
- **Consumer Confidence Index** – High confidence = more spending likely.

👉 Think: _“What’s coming up?”_

### 🔹 Lagging Indicators

These change **after the economy or markets have already shifted**.
They’re **confirmatory** — they validate trends that have already started.

**Examples:**

- **Unemployment Rate** – Often falls only after recovery is well underway.
- **Corporate Earnings** – Reported after the quarter ends, reflecting past performance.
- **Inflation Rate (CPI, PPI)** – Shows how prices have already moved.
- **Interest Rates (as set by central banks)** – Usually adjusted in response to past conditions.
- **Balance of Trade / Debt Levels** – Reflects past economic activity.

👉 Think: _“What already happened?”_

### 🔹 Key Difference

- **Leading = Predictive** → They try to _forecast_ the future.
- **Lagging = Confirmatory** → They _validate_ what has already occurred.

# Conclusion

✅ **Quick Analogy:**

- **Leading indicators** are like the weather forecast.
- **Lagging indicators** are like looking outside and seeing that it rained yesterday.
