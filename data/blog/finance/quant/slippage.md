# Introduction

Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed. It most commonly occurs during periods of high volatility or when large orders are placed in markets with low liquidity.

For example, if you place a market order to buy a stock at $100, but your order is filled at $100.50, the $0.50 difference is slippage. This can happen because there may not be enough sellers at your desired price, or prices may move quickly before your order is completed.

## Why Does Slippage Happen?

Slippage happens for several reasons:

- **Market Volatility:** Prices can change rapidly, especially during news events or high activity.
- **Order Size:** Large orders may "eat through" available prices in the order book, causing the execution to occur at less favorable prices.
- **Liquidity:** In thinly traded markets, there may not be enough buyers or sellers at a given price, so orders are filled at the next available price.

## How Does Slippage Affect Traders?

Slippage can impact both buyers and sellers. For buyers, it means paying more than expected; for sellers, it means receiving less. It is especially important for active traders and those trading large positions to understand and manage slippage.

## How to Minimize Slippage

- Use limit orders instead of market orders to control the price at which your trade is executed.
- Trade in highly liquid markets where there are many buyers and sellers.
- Avoid trading during periods of extreme volatility unless necessary.

Understanding slippage helps traders set realistic expectations and choose strategies that minimize its impact on their results.

# Conclusion

Slippage is an unavoidable part of trading, especially in fast-moving or illiquid markets. By understanding its causes and effects, traders can make smarter decisions, use appropriate order types, and better manage their risk. While it cannot be eliminated entirely, being aware of slippage and planning for it can help you achieve more consistent trading results.
