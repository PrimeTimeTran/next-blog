# Essential Statistics Topics for Quant Finance

Quantitative finance relies heavily on statistics to analyze data, model risk, and make predictions. Here are the core statistics topics and modules you should master:

## 1. Descriptive Statistics

- [Mean, median, mode](/blog/maths/statistics/mean-median-mode)
- [Variance, standard deviation](/blog/maths/statistics/variance-standard-deviation)
- Skewness, kurtosis
- Data visualization (histograms, box plots)

## 2. Probability Theory

- Probability distributions (normal, lognormal, binomial, Poisson, etc.)
- Random variables
- Expectation, variance
- Law of large numbers, central limit theorem

## 3. Statistical Inference

- Sampling methods
- Estimation (point, interval)
- Hypothesis testing
- p-values, confidence intervals

## 4. Regression Analysis

- Simple and multiple linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Residual analysis
- Model selection and diagnostics

## 5. Time Series Analysis

- Stationarity
- Autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation
- AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA models
- Volatility modeling (GARCH)
- Forecasting

## 6. Multivariate Statistics

- Covariance and correlation matrices
- Principal component analysis (PCA)
- Factor models
- Dimensionality reduction

## 7. Bayesian Statistics

- Bayesâ€™ theorem
- Prior, likelihood, posterior
- Bayesian inference and updating

## 8. Nonparametric Methods

- Rank-based tests
- Kernel density estimation
- Bootstrap methods

## 9. Machine Learning & Statistical Learning

- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Classification, regression, clustering
- Overfitting, cross-validation
- Feature selection

## 10. Risk and Performance Metrics

- Value at Risk (VaR)
- Expected Shortfall
- Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio
- Drawdown analysis

## 11. Simulation Methods

- Monte Carlo simulation
- Scenario analysis
- Random number generation

## 12. Optimization

- Linear and nonlinear programming
- Constrained optimization
- Portfolio optimization

# Conclusion

Mastering these statistics topics will provide a strong foundation for quantitative finance. Each area builds skills for analyzing financial data, modeling uncertainty, and making informed investment decisions.
