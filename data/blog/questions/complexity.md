1. Break it down:
   "I start by breaking the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. By understanding each component separately, it’s easier to see how they fit together."

2. Prioritize and organize:
   "Next, I identify which parts are critical or time-sensitive, and I tackle those first. I often make a plan or a visual map to organize dependencies and steps."

3. Use abstraction and simplification:
   "I look for ways to abstract or simplify repetitive or complex patterns, so I can handle them without reinventing the wheel."

4. Collaborate and seek clarity:
   "If the complexity involves multiple teams or systems, I make sure to communicate clearly, ask questions, and align with others to avoid misunderstandings."

5. Iterate and refine:
   "Finally, I approach it iteratively—implementing solutions in small steps, testing, and refining as I go, rather than trying to solve everything at once."

# Conclusion

I deal with complexity by breaking problems down, prioritizing and organizing, simplifying where possible, collaborating effectively, and iterating incrementally to ensure robust solutions.
