# Introduction

## Data Structures & Algorithms

- [Subarray] - A contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
- [Combinations] - A selection of items from a set that has distinct members.
- [Permutations] - An arrangement of objects in a specific order, where the sequence matters
- [Amortized Analysis] - A method for analyzing a given algorithm's complexity, or how much of a resource, especially time or memory, it takes to execute; considering both the costly and less costly operations together over the whole sequence of operations.
- [Invariant] - A condition or relation that is always true. Constant and unchanging even if the conditions that it's in changes.
- [Monotonic Predicate] - A condition or property that, when applied to a set of inputs (often Boolean or ordered), exhibits a consistent trend: if it's true for a given input, it remains true (or becomes "more true") for "larger" inputs, and if false, it remains false (or becomes "less false") for "smaller" inputs.
