That’s a great direction—doing low-level projects with Rust can teach you a lot about systems programming, memory management, OS design, and more. In a college setting, especially in systems or operating systems classes, you’d typically see projects like these:

---

## 🧠 Classic Low-Level Projects You Can Build in Rust

### 1. **Memory Allocator**

- **What**: Implement a custom malloc/free (a memory allocator).
- **Why**: Learn about heap management, fragmentation, alignment, and system calls (`mmap`, `sbrk` in C, or `alloc` traits in Rust).
- **Rust Tip**: Use `unsafe` code with care; you’ll need it.

---

### 2. **Operating System Kernel (Hobby OS)**

- **What**: Build a minimal kernel that boots, prints to screen, handles interrupts.
- **Why**: Classic systems project. You’ll learn bootloaders, paging, and x86_64 internals.
- **Tools**: Rust + `no_std` + `x86_64` crate.
- **Project**: [Phil Opp’s Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) (gold standard).

---

### 3. **Command-Line Shell**

- **What**: A shell that reads input, parses commands, runs them via system calls.
- **Why**: Learn about process management, pipes, `fork`, and `exec`.
- **Rust Concepts**: Process spawning, `std::process`, piping with `ChildStdin`, `ChildStdout`.

---

### 4. **File System**

- **What**: Implement a simple in-memory or on-disk file system (e.g., FAT-like or ext2).
- **Why**: Learn about blocks, directories, inodes.
- **Rust Concepts**: Trait design, byte-level manipulation, memory-mapped I/O.

---

### 5. **Virtual Machine / Bytecode Interpreter**

- **What**: Build a VM for a toy language (like a Stack VM or Lisp interpreter).
- **Why**: Understand parsing, instruction dispatch, and memory models.
- **Rust Concepts**: Enums with `match`, vectors as stacks, `Rc` or `Arc` for memory management.

---

### 6. **Multithreaded Web Server**

- **What**: A basic HTTP server with thread pool or async support.
- **Why**: Learn sockets, threads, async runtimes.
- **Rust Concepts**: `std::net`, `std::thread`, `tokio` or `async-std`.

---

### 7. **Bootloader for Raspberry Pi / Bare Metal Project**

- **What**: Write code that runs without an OS, e.g., for ARM on a Pi.
- **Why**: Push Rust to the edge—no `std`, only direct hardware access.
- **Tools**: `no_std`, linker scripts, target specification.

---

### 8. **Database Engine (like a Tiny SQL)**

- **What**: A single-file SQL-like database or key-value store.
- **Why**: Learn storage, indexing (B-trees), page management.
- **Inspiration**: [cstack’s sqlite clone](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/) (in C).

## 🧪 Bonus Ideas for Class-Level Projects

| Project                | Skills Learned                            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Ray Tracer             | Geometry, math, memory optimization       |
| Emulator (e.g. CHIP-8) | CPU emulation, timers, graphics           |
| Kernel Module (Linux)  | System internals, syscalls                |
| Static Code Analyzer   | AST parsing, pattern matching             |
| Syscall Tracer         | Use `ptrace` or similar to trace syscalls |

## 🔧 Tips for Doing These in Rust

- Use `unsafe` only when needed, and encapsulate it.
- Start with `cargo new --lib` for libraries and `--bin` for binaries.
- Look into crates like `bitflags`, `byteorder`, `nix`, and `x86_64`.

Would you like recommendations tailored to the kind of class (OS, networking, security, etc.) or your current level of Rust?
