# Introduction

My playbook on how to familiarize myself with a framework.

## Mobile Developer Checklist

A list of skills/concepts I believe are fundamental to understand before
identifying myself as knowledgeable in a mobile framework.

Each with their own programming languages, apis, tools, and conventions which have
evolved over the years.

Whether it's JS/TS for React Native, Dart for Flutter, Obj-C/Swift for iOS,
Java/Kotlin for Android; the same skills are necessary
for proficiently at using that framework.
