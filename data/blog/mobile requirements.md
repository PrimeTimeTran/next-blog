## Mobile Developer Checklist

A list of skills/concepts I believe are fundamental to understand before
identifying myself as knowledgeable in a mobile framework.

React Native, Flutter, Android, iOS. All frameworks I've used over the years.

Each with their own programming languages, apis, tools, and conventions which have
evolved over the years.

Whether it's JS/TS for React Native, Dart for Flutter, Obj-C/Swift for iOS,
Java/Kotlin for Android; the same skills are necessary
for proficiently at using that framework.
