## Mobile Developer Checklist

A list of skills/concepts I think it's important to understand before
identifying myself as knowledge in a mobile development framework.

Whether it be

- React Native
- Flutter
- Android
- iOS

I have to know how to do each of these things before I can confidently say I know the framework.

### Intro

- Navigation

  - Bottom tab
  - Drawer/Sidebar
  - Stack

- Render UI elements such as text, images, icons

  - Change text/image/icon size
  - Change text/image/icon color

- Fetch data

- Store global state
