# Introduction

Type of acquisition.

Board of directors talk to the company if everything goes well it happens. If price and deal makes sense everyone agrees. Friendly.

Hostile is different. The process turns into a fight. Leadership doesn't want to sell & the buyer still wants control.
They don't negotiate with management but goes around them to gain control. Must control 50% > shares you can control the company.

## Offense

### 1. Tender Offer

Go directly to the shareholders to offer to buy at 20% premium.
If enough of you agree we'll take over.
Oracle taking over PeopleSoft.

### 2. Bear Hug

Sends public open letter with a price to board.

Elon vs Twitter.

Shareholders now ask why they wouldn't take the deal.

### 3. Proxy Fight

Going away the votes.
Acquire control of the company by controlling the board.

Replace old board members with your own allies. They can now approve the offer.

2008 Carl Ichan. Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo but board rejected.
Ichan thought it was a mistake and did this.

### 4. Toe Hold

Instead of coming in with a big flask offer. Buy shares on the open market until you hold an influential position.
Porsche takeover Volkswagen.

Quietly accumulate stock

### 5. Forced Consolidation

Join or be crushed. John D Rockefeller.

Sell out now or we'll outlast/outspend/outsize you in the long run.

## Defense

### 1. Poison Pill

15% of shares. Every other shareholder gets the right to buy more at a discount.

### 2. Staggered Board

Counter to proxy fight strategy. Only a fraction of board members are up for an election in a given year.

### 3. Green Mail

Hostile buyer has big chunk of shares and threatens a takeover. Target company offers to buy back at a premium. Paying a briber.

### 4. Golden Parachute

If management is let go of during take over then executives entitled to payout.

### 5. White Squire/Knight

Friendly company which makes it's own offer. Usually at a better price or better terms. Agree to take over a big enough stake to block buy from taking complete control.

### 6. Crown Jewel Defense

Throwing wallet in the sewer so mugger has nothing important to take anymore.
Move assets into another vehicle/company so that the takeover is no longer as valuable.

### 7. Jonestown Defense

Destroy your own companies value to prevent it from being taken over. Selling divisions at a huge loss.

### 8. Pacman Defense

Eat cookie and turn around on the hostile company. Try to acquire them. Aggressive & risky but usually involves borrowing tons of money.
