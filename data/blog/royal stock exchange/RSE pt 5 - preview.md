## Royal Stock Exchange(RSE) - Flutter Time Series with Sync Fusion Charts - Part 5

![Web Dark preview](https://s12.gifyu.com/images/SQiM7.gif)

A month into building RSE we've accomplished a lot on the UI side.

- Fetching portfolio data to render a line chart for the user.
- Responding to hover events to update the chart header on the price of the
  security at the point in time they hover vs at period start.
- Fetching news data to render articles for the user to read.
- Drawer, Tab & Stack navigation with Go Router.
- A candle chart.
- Time period selection for viewing an securities price over time periods of
  live, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, year to date, and 1 year.
- An investing screen for viewing the diversity of the users portfolio via a
  doughnut chart.
