# Introduction

Infinitesimal Calculus. The mathematics of all things that change.

## First Principles

### 1. **Derivative from First Principles (Definition of the Derivative)**

The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x$ is defined as:

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

This is called the **first principles definition of the derivative**.
It expresses the **instantaneous rate of change** (or slope of the tangent line) by looking at the ratio of change in output to change in input, as the change in input ($h$) gets arbitrarily small.

### 2. **Integral from First Principles (Definition of the Definite Integral)**

The integral is defined as the **limit of Riemann sums**:

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*) \, \Delta x
$$

where:

- $[a, b]$ is the interval,
- $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}$,
- $x_i^*$ is a chosen sample point in each subinterval.

This definition formalizes the idea of finding **area under a curve** by approximating it with rectangles and then making the approximation infinitely precise.

### 3. **The Limit Concept (Underlying Both)**

Both derivatives and integrals rest on the **concept of a limit**, which is the _true first principle of calculus_.

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x)
$$

is the idea that we can make $f(x)$ arbitrarily close to some number $L$ by making $x$ sufficiently close to $a$.

Without limits, neither derivatives nor integrals could be rigorously defined.

✅ **Summary:**

- **Limit** → the foundation.
- **Derivative (first principles definition)** → slope of tangent / rate of change.
- **Integral (first principles definition)** → area under a curve / accumulation.
