# Introduction

## Series

Adding up numbers given a pattern

### Power Series

Summation of the coefficient
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}  {C}_{n}x^{n}$$
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}  {C}_{n}x^{n} = {C}_{0}x^{0} + {C}_{1}x^{1} + {C}_{2} x^{2} + \space ...$$

#### Benefits

Used to approximate difficult functions

### Taylor Series

Specialty: Series expansion of a function about a specific point.

$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}  {\frac{f^{n}(a)}{n!}}(x-a)^2$$

Outputs a polynomial: Taylor Polynomial

$$= f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x+a)^2 $$

Approximation of a function at a certain point.

Increase the value of n creates a more accurate approximation of the function

### Convergence & Divergence

### Convergence

Partial sums approach a certain value
$$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-\frac{1}{2})^k = \frac{1}{1-(-\frac{1}{2})} = \frac{2}{3}$$

$$1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} + \space ... \space = \frac{2}{3}$$

### Divergence

Partial sums usually approach -+ infinity

$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}2^{n} = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + \space ... $$

## Ratio Test

The ratio test is a method used to determine the convergence or divergence of infinite series, especially those involving factorials or exponentials.

$$
\\lim_{n \to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \\right|
 **Statement:** For a series $\sum a_n$, compute:

$$L = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right|$$

- **If** $L < 1$: The series converges absolutely.
- **If** $L > 1$ or $L = \infty$: The series diverges.
- **If** $L = 1$: The test is inconclusive.
- **If** $ L < 1 $: The series converges absolutely.
- **If** $ L > 1 $ or $ L = \\infty $: The series diverges.
- **If** $ L = 1 $: The test is inconclusive.
- Commonly used for series with factorials, powers, or exponential terms.
- Helps quickly identify convergence for many common series in calculus.

## Integrals
Finding the area under the line/curve of a graph.

### Rules
- Power Rule
  $$\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$$
- Exponential
  $$\int e^{x} \, dx = e^{x} + C$$
- Constant Multiples
  $$\int a f(x) \, dx = a \int f(x) \, dx$$
- Absolute Values
  $$\int |x| \, dx = \frac{1}{2}x|x| + C$$
- Sum & Differences
  $$\int [f(x) \pm g(x)] \, dx = \int f(x) \, dx \pm \int g(x) \, dx$$


### Integration Techniques
Some functions are too complicated. So rules don't cut it. That's why we have

- **Integration of Partial Fractions:**

  Decompose a complex rational function into simpler fractions that can be integrated individually. Used when the integrand is a ratio of polynomials. Example: $\int \frac{1}{x^2-1} dx$ can be split into $\int \frac{1}{2(x-1)} dx + \int \frac{1}{2(x+1)} dx$.

- **Integration By Parts:**

  Based on the product rule for differentiation. Used to integrate products of functions. Formula: $\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du$. Choose $u$ and $dv$ wisely for easier integration.

- **Polynomial Long Division:**

  When the degree of the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator, divide first to simplify the integrand. Example: $\int \frac{x^2+2x+1}{x+1} dx$ becomes $\int (x+1) dx$ after division.

- **Use Substitution:**

  Change the variable of integration to simplify the integral, often used for composite functions. Let $u = g(x)$, then $du = g'(x) dx$. Example: $\int 2x \cos(x^2) dx$ with $u = x^2$.

- **Trigonometric Substitution:**

  Substitute trigonometric functions for algebraic expressions to simplify integrals involving square roots. Example: For $\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} dx$, use $x = a \sin \theta$.


### Applications of Integrals
Physics.
  - Center of mass of rigid bodies.
  - Calculate total work done.
  - Find magnetic field imposed at a particular point due to an infinite wire.
