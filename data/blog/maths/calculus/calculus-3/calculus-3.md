## Vectors and Geometry of Space

Learn about vectors, dot and cross products, and the geometry of lines, planes, and surfaces in three dimensions. These concepts are foundational for understanding spatial relationships and physical phenomena in higher dimensions.

## Partial Derivatives

Explore functions of several variables, limits, continuity, and differentiation with respect to multiple variables. Partial derivatives are essential for analyzing how functions change in multivariable contexts.

## Multiple Integrals

Study double and triple integrals, which allow you to compute areas, volumes, and solve physical problems involving accumulation over regions in space.

## Vector Calculus

Understand vector fields, line integrals, surface integrals, and the fundamental theorems: Green's, Stokes', and Divergence. These tools are crucial for advanced applications in physics and engineering.

## Applications

Apply multivariable calculus to optimization problems (including Lagrange multipliers), change of variables, and real-world scenarios in physics and engineering.
