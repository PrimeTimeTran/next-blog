## Information Security Practices & Linux

I discovered [Over The Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) a while back
and have been working on their problems.

It's a online tool where we play a quasi capture the flag game.

We're tasked to find a password on a remote server. We SSH into a remote server
and get a password which gives us access to the next server/level.

In each server the password/level becomes increasingly difficult to find and we
learn concepts like linux, encryption, decryption, file compression,
in detail.
