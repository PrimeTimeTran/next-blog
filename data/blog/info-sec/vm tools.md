## UTM

.NET Framework only runs on Windows.

So you've got a few choices to choose from if you need to work with it.

- Purchase a Windows machine
- Use a [Desktop as a Service](https://www.g2.com/products/amazon-workspaces/reviews) like Amazon Workspaces
- Install Windows in VM

I decided to go with the **last** option.

Although these are many other tools for installing VMs available, [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)
seemed to be the easiest one for ARM64 architecture(perhaps the only one).

I was able to setup a Windows & Kali machine in about 2 hours(including
download times) so I'd highly recommend it if you have the same requirements.

I decided to go ahead and install Kali too to practice my infosec skills
as well since I was already in the neighborhood.
