# Introduction

Here are a few things to consider when trying to identify what data structure to use for algorithms.

We'll cover the following sorting algorithms.

- [Array / List](#array--list)
- [Hash Table / Map](#hash-table--map)
- [Set](#set)
- [Stack](#stack)
- [Queue](#queue)
- [Deque](#deque)
- [Linked List](#linked-list)
- [Tree](#tree)
  - [Binary Tree](#binary-tree)
    - [Binary Search Tree](#binary-search-tree)
    - [Segment Tree](#segment-tree)
    - [Heap](#heap)
  - [Trie](#trie)
- [Graph](#graph)
- [Union-Find (Disjoint Set)](#union-find-disjoint-set)

## Overview

| Data Structure              | Typical Use Cases                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stack                       | Undo operations, expression parsing, backtracking, DFS    |
| Queue                       | Scheduling, BFS, order of processing                      |
| Deque                       | Sliding window problems, double-ended queue operations    |
| Heap (Priority Queue)       | Getting largest/smallest elements efficiently, scheduling |
| Hash Table (Map)            | Fast lookups, counting, caching                           |
| Set                         | Fast membership tests, removing duplicates                |
| Array/List                  | Index-based access, iteration                             |
| Linked List                 | Efficient insertions/deletions at head/tail               |
| Binary Tree                 | Hierarchical data, expression parsing                     |
| Binary Search Tree (BST)    | Sorted data, efficient range queries                      |
| Trie (Prefix Tree)          | Prefix search, autocomplete                               |
| Graph                       | Network problems, pathfinding, connected components       |
| Union-Find (Disjoint Set)   | Connectivity queries, Kruskalâ€™s algorithm                 |
| Segment Tree / Fenwick Tree | Range queries and updates (e.g., sum, min, max)           |

## Array/List

## Hash Table/Map

## Set

## Stack

Last In First Out(L.I.F.O.)

| Situation                                      | Use   | Reasoning / Pattern              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| Need to process elements in reverse order      | Stack | LIFO (Last In, First Out)        |
| Tracking function calls / recursion            | Stack | Call stack mirrors nested calls  |
| Undo functionality (e.g., editor)              | Stack | Last action undone first         |
| Balanced parentheses / bracket matching        | Stack | Pairs resolved in reverse order  |
| Need to process elements in the order received | Queue | FIFO (First In, First Out)       |
| Level-order traversal of tree (BFS)            | Queue | Process nodes layer by layer     |
| Scheduling tasks / simulation                  | Queue | Tasks processed in arrival order |

## Queue

First In First Out(F.I.F.O.)

## Deque

Double ended queue

## Linked List

A linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are linked together.

## Tree

A data structure composed of nodes that contain values & leafs.

### Binary Tree

A tree where each node has only two children nodes, left & right.

#### Binary Search Tree(BST)

A binary search tree where the value of the left child is less than the parent node's value. The right node's value is greater than the parent node's value.

#### Heap

| Situation                    | Use                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Always want largest/smallest | Max/Min heap               |
| Keep top K of something      | Min/Max heap of size K     |
| Custom processing order      | Priority queue (heap)      |
| Streaming data               | Heap(s) to track top items |

#### Segment Tree/Fenwick Tree

### Trie(Prefix Tree)

## Graph

Nodes & Edges.
Node's are airports and edges are the flights between them.

Furthermore graphs can be directed or undirected meaning that the flights can be listed as pointing from one airport to another or both ways(undirected).

The edges can have weighted as well meaning that the edges from one node to another may vary in value. For example the price from an airport to airport a & b may differ.

## Union-Find(Disjoint Set)
