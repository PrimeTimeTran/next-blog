## Information Security Practices & Linux

I discovered this [Over The Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) a while back and have been working on their problems.

It's a online tool where we play a quasi capture the flag game.

We are tasked to find a password on a remote server. We SSH into a remote server and get a password which gives us access to the next server/level.

In each server the password/level becomes increasingly difficult to find and we learn some cool concepts such as linux, encryption, decryption, file compression, and so much more.

<div class="tab">
  <button id="js-button" class="tablinks">javascript</button>
  <button id="python-button" class="tablinks">python</button>
  <button id="dart-button" class="tablinks">tokyo</button>
</div>

<div id="js" class="tabcontent" style={{display: 'block'}}>
  ```python
  print('Hi)
  ```
</div>

<div id="python" class="tabcontent">
  ```js
  console.log('gogogo)
  ```
</div>

<div id="dart" class="tabcontent">
  ```dart
  void main() {
    print('Hello, World!');
  }
  ```
</div>
