# Introduction

RDDT has a market cap of 38.08 billion.

Yet their mobile app has what I would say is a
basic noticeable business logic error which I find surprising.

There're duplicate posts in a ListView on a group which I follow, [WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/).

In the following video notice a post by `FinishWarm1746`
with the body "GG TSM ðŸ«¡" is rendered multiple times in quick succession.

# Conclusion

I share this to remind myself and others that even multi billion dollar companies
such as RDDT can still have mistakes that land in production when they're serving millions of customers around the world.

I hope that this motivates other developers to be more confident in themselves and helps hiring managers at larger cap
companies to be more compassionate in their evaluation of candidates applying for roles at their firms in the future and will continue to do this
in the future.
