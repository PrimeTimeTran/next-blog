## Royal Stock Exchange - A .NET project for career development & personal growth

For years I had the belief that as a software developer, I should focus on being
the best developer I can be, and that'd be my ticket to financial success.

We can't do everything after all, we only have [so many fcuks to give.](https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713)

That being said, I've decided in order to achieve some of my financial goals,
I should learn finance/trading.

Specifically day trading.

At the very least, I'll have a better idea of what people in finance
are talking about when I'm with VCs and people in the industry.

In the middle of the road, I'll be a more compelling hire at a finance company
in the future.

And the best, I'll be able to make enough money trading to retire early/work for
myself.

To that end, I've decided to build a stock exchange, Royal Stock Exchange.

Technology:

- .NET server
- Flutter client

I'll be documenting my research and process along the way to hopefully cement my
learning of .NET as well as finance.

### Intro

Today I initialized a project using [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).
