Today I passed my [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) exam.

Earning this certification will give you foundational knowledge into the vast array of services offered by AWS
in their cloud computing ecosystem.

You'll also learn some computer science fundamentals along the way such as networking & security.

Here's a overview of the journey through the AWS ecosystem.

## Background

Why spend all time and money to get certified if we can deploy using
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) & [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and call it a day?

Here are a few reasons

- Knowledge
  - Have more meaningful conversations
- Higher Salary
- Confidence
- Ability
- Business Value

## Quizlet

[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) is a flashcard [SaaS](<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-saas/#:~:text=Software%20as%20a%20service%20(SaaS)%20allows%20users%20to%20connect%20to,from%20a%20cloud%20service%20provider.>).

## Udemy

Inspired by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/inline-toc) and Gatsby's [gatsby-remark-table-of-contents](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-table-of-contents/),
the `toc` variable containing all the top level headings of the document is passed to the MDX file and can be styled accordingly.
To make generating a table of contents (TOC) simple, you can use the existing `TOCInline` component.

For example, the TOC in this post was generated with the following code:

```jsx
<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />
```

You can customise the headings that are displayed by configuring the `fromHeading` and `toHeading` props, or exclude particular headings
by passing a string or a string array to the `exclude` prop. By default, all headings that are of depth 3 or smaller are indented. This can be configured by changing the `indentDepth` property.
A `asDisclosure` prop can be used to render the TOC within an expandable disclosure element.

Here's the full TOC rendered in a disclosure element.

```jsx
<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />
```

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />

## YouTube

You can map mdx blog content to layout components by configuring the frontmatter field. For example, this post is written with the new `PostSimple` layout!

### Adding new templates

layout templates are stored in the `./layouts` folder. You can add your React components that you want to map to markdown content in this folder.
The component file name must match that specified in the markdown frontmatter `layout` field.

The only required field is `children` which contains the rendered MDX content, though you would probably want to pass in the frontMatter contents and render it in the template.

You can configure the template to take in other fields - see `PostLayout` component for an example.

Here's an example layout which you can further customise:

```jsx
export default function ExampleLayout({ frontMatter, children }) {
  const { date, title } = frontMatter

  return (
    <SectionContainer>
      <div>{date}</div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <div>{children}</div>
    </SectionContainer>
  )
}
```

### Configuring a blog post frontmatter

Use the `layout` frontmatter field to specify the template you want to map the markdown post to. Here's how the frontmatter of this post looks like:

tags: ['next-js', 'tailwind', 'guide']

summary: 'Introducing the new layout features - you can map mdx blog content to layout components by configuring the frontmatter field'
layout: PostSimple
---
```

You can configure the default layout in the respective page section by modifying the `DEFAULT_LAYOUT` variable.
The `DEFAULT_LAYOUT` for blog posts page is set to `PostLayout`.

### Extend

`layout` is mapped to wrapper which wraps the entire MDX content.

```jsx
export const MDXComponents = {
  Image,
  a: CustomLink,
  pre: Pre,
  wrapper: ({ components, layout, ...rest }) => {
    const Layout = require(`../layouts/${layout}`).default
    return <Layout {...rest} />
  },
}

export const MDXLayoutRenderer = ({ layout, mdxSource, ...rest }) => {
  const MDXLayout = useMemo(() => getMDXComponent(mdxSource), [mdxSource])

  return <MDXLayout layout={layout} components={MDXComponents} {...rest} />
}
```

Use the `MDXLayoutRenderer` component on a page where you want to accept a layout name to map to the desired layout.
You need to pass the layout name from the layout folder (it has to be an exact match).

## AWS Documentation

The official [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html?nc2=h_ql_doc_do_v) is last.

The reason why I listed it last is because without a "foundational" start, reading through them and the various Whitepapers would feel like toture
if you're anything like me.
