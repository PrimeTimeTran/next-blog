Today I passed my [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) exam.

In this blogpost I review the things I did to prepare for the exam.

## Why work on AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification?

Why spend all time and money to get certified if we can deploy using
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) & [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and call it a day?

Here are a few reasons

- Higher Salary
  - We could all use more money after all
- Confidence
  - Speak with authority with peers
- Knowledge
  - Understand the value proposition which put Amazon in FAANG
- Business Value
  - Understand how AWS can help you if you're planning on
    building the next silicon valley unicorn

## Quizlet

I used [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/). It's is a flashcard [SaaS](<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-saas/#:~:text=Software%20as%20a%20service%20(SaaS)%20allows%20users%20to%20connect%20to,from%20a%20cloud%20service%20provider.>)
which gamify's learning. Create flashcards which generate games for checkpoints, learning, testing, and competition.

## Udemy

Inspired by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/inline-toc) and Gatsby's [gatsby-remark-table-of-contents](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-table-of-contents/),

## YouTube

Watch videos daily
Document content on Quizlet
Simplify concepts where I could
Google and/or review AWS documentation when I didn't understand a concept/content in video

## AWS Documentation

The official [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html?nc2=h_ql_doc_do_v) is last.

The reason why I listed it last is because without a "foundational" start, reading through them and the various Whitepapers would feel like toture
if you're anything like me.
