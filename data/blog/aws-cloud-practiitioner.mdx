Today I passed my [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) exam.

Earning this certification will give you foundational knowledge into the vast array of services offered by AWS
in their cloud computing ecosystem.

You'll also learn some computer science fundamentals along the way such as networking & security.

Here's a overview of the journey through the AWS ecosystem.

## Background

Why spend all time and money to get certified if we can deploy using
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) & [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and call it a day?

Here are a few reasons

- Knowledge
  - Have more meaningful conversations
- Higher Salary
- Confidence
- Ability
- Business Value

## Quizlet

[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) is a flashcard [SaaS](<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-saas/#:~:text=Software%20as%20a%20service%20(SaaS)%20allows%20users%20to%20connect%20to,from%20a%20cloud%20service%20provider.>).

## Udemy

Inspired by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/inline-toc) and Gatsby's [gatsby-remark-table-of-contents](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-table-of-contents/),

## YouTube

## Simplilearn

The simplilearn channel

## AWS Documentation

The official [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html?nc2=h_ql_doc_do_v) is last.

The reason why I listed it last is because without a "foundational" start, reading through them and the various Whitepapers would feel like toture
if you're anything like me.
