# Introduction

I recently added a few features to [BakeSuite](http://bakesuite.com.au/) after taking some time away from the project.

1. I fixed an issue where Canva sign in didn't work as expected.

2. I added the ability to add images to a 3D rendered graphic tool used to enable bakers to illustrate the final product to customers.

3. And lastly I added the ability to toggle the colors of a .SVG stroke for assets added to the cakes.

# Conclusion

I last used [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) at [ScanLabMR](https://scanlabmr.com/) a few years ago.

It felt good to be able to circle back to it, the skills having transferred to a new project.
