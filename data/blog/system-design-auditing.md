# Introduction

The design specs in this demo are common in enterprise applications.

- Implement auditing that saves meta data to the DB on requests to a resource `AuditLog`.
- `AuditLog` stores:
  - Resource acted on.
  - User who made the request.
  - Method called
  - Timestamps

The requirements sound simple enough but require a few advanced techniques to arrive at an elegant solution.

### 1. Initialize Project

We'll use Nuxt for this project as it's convention over configuration paradigm makes
it an attractive solution in 2025 Web Development.

```sh
npm create nuxt nuxt_closure
cd nuxt_closure
npm run dev
```

### 2. Install dependencies

We use token based authentication as this is industry standard & allows us to
audit users from any platform much more easily.

```sh
npm i jsonwebtoken @types/jsonwebtoken
```

### 3. Define JWT Token for security

We just defining the logic for signing and verifying the token we give to users
of our system.

```ts
// ./server/utils/token.ts
import type { JwtPayload } from 'jsonwebtoken'
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'

export function jwtSign(payload: any, expiresIn?: string | number | null) {
  let expiresInOrNull: string | number | null =
    expiresIn || process.env.AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN || '3650 days'

  if (expiresInOrNull === Infinity) {
    expiresInOrNull = null
  }

  return jwt.sign(
    payload,
    String(process.env.AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET),
    expiresInOrNull
      ? {
          expiresIn: expiresInOrNull,
        }
      : undefined
  )
}

export interface Payload {
  email?: string
  token?: string
}

export type PayloadObj = string | JwtPayload | Payload | null

export function jwtVerify(token: string): PayloadObj | null {
  try {
    const payload: PayloadObj = jwt.verify(token, String(process.env.AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET))
    return payload
  } catch (error) {
    return null
  }
}
```

### 4. Add .env file

Define the following secret inside of a root `.env` file.

```bash
# ./.env
AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET="MySecret"
```

### 5. Test Sign & Verify using script

Ensure that the token creation and verification work in a script before trying to access it
via API.

```ts
// ./server/script.ts
import { jwtSign, jwtVerify } from './utils/token'

async function main() {
  const token = await jwtSign({
    email: 'loi@ltran.net',
  })

  console.log({ token })

  const user = await jwtVerify(token)

  console.log({ user })
}

main()
```

```sh
npx tsx server/script.ts
```

We should now see that we're able to encode our `user` object with `jwtSign`.
After doing that we're returned a `token` which we can pass to `jwtVerify` to get back
our initial `user` object.

```sh
$ npx tsx server/script.ts
{
  token: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6ImxvaUBsdHJhbi5uZXQiLCJpYXQiOjE3NDUxMDk2MTcsImV4cCI6MjA2MDQ2OTYxN30.V6tHkhphtu7BsWsGVxTBrb8kMfGQuFVv_8BgcsW85tg'
}
{ user: { email: 'loi@ltran.net', iat: 1745109617, exp: 2060469617 } }
```

### 6. Define API for resources

We need an example API which'll be accessed by consumers of our API.

```ts
// ./server/api/index.get.ts
export default defineEventHandler(async () => {
  return {
    wizards: ['Harry', 'Hermione', 'Ron'],
  }
})
```

We can now request JSON at our APIs index route.

```sh
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:3001/api

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 01:00:20 GMT
connection: close
content-length: 61

{
  "wizards": [
    "Harry",
    "Hermione",
    "Ron"
  ]
}
```

So we now have an API which serves resources to clients.

### 7. Add Middlewares(2) to grab token from request headers & decode the user object out of the payload

Run reuseable logic for each inbound request.
Read the token from the header.

```ts
// server/middlewares/00.headers.global.js
export default defineEventHandler((e) => {
  const authHeader = getHeader(e, 'authorization')
  if (authHeader && authHeader.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
    e.context.token = authHeader.slice(7)
  }
})
```

Using the token find the `User` in our DB.

```ts
// server/middlewares/01.user.global.js
import { User } from '../models/User.model'

export default defineEventHandler(async (e) => {
  const user = jwtVerify(e.context.token)
  console.log({ user })
  if (user) {
    const id = user.userId
    const me = await User.findById(id).exec()
    e.context.user = me
  }
})
```

We pass in the token we manually created earlier in the headers following best practices.
The numbering is important here. The middleware beginning with `00` will run before `01`.
So we'll extract the token first then use it to query our DB for our user.

```sh
$ curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6ImxvaUBsdHJhbi5uZXQiLCJpYXQiOjE3NDUxMTI1MDAsImV4cCI6MjA2MDQ3MjUwMH0.m66vk-I0HJhJOU9vcz61zrQzI_Mbnr-50P8B-_DQqNo" http://localhost:3001/api
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
date: Sun, 20 Apr 2025 01:28:59 GMT
connection: close
content-length: 61

{
  "wizards": [
    "Harry",
    "Hermione",
    "Ron"
  ]
}
```

### 8. Install Nuxt Mongoose

Install Mongoose as our DB.

```sh
npm i nuxt-mongoose
```

This configuration is required in the setup process.

```js
// ./nuxt.config.js
mongoose: {
  options: {},
  modelsDir: 'models',
  uri: process.env.MONGODB_URI,
},
```

Add the following variable to your `.env` file.

```js
// ./.env
MONGODB_URI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/nuxt-closure'
```

### 9. Add Models for Auditing

The crux of this system design.
When resources are touched a hook will fire which ultimately records meta data to our `auditlogs` collection.

1. We define a resource(User) which triggers hooks by passing it's schema to our `Auditor`
2. We define a resource(Auditlog) which stores the data we want on API requests.
3. We define our workhorse audit middleware which triggers a closure that captures the API request event.
4. We define reuseable methods `createEntry`, `createHook`, `addHooks` which handle building the log which is eventually stored in our DB.

<div className="tab-group">
  <div className="tab">
    <button id="#1" className="tablinks">1. Create example `User` resource</button>
    <button id="#2" className="tablinks">2. Define DB `Audit` resource</button>
    <button id="#3" className="tablinks">3. Define `Audit` Middleware</button>
    <button id="#4" className="tablinks">4. Define reuseable hooks & helpers</button>
  </div>

  <div id="#1" className="tabcontent">
    ```js {} showLineNumbers {22}
    // .server/models/User.model.js

    import mongoose, { Schema } from 'mongoose'
    import { Auditor } from './Audit'

    const userSchema = new Schema({
      email: {
        type: String,
      },
      firstName: {
        type: String,
      },
      lastName: {
        type: String,
      },
    })

    userSchema.virtual('fullName').get(function () {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    })

    Auditor.addHooks(userSchema)

    export { userSchema }
    export const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema)

    // 1. We invoke `addHooks` of Auditor passing in the current resource's schema.
    // 2. Auditor defines the hooks of this resource during build/initialization time.
    // 3. Downstream, when a `save`, `update`, or `remove` event is detected helper methods defined within `Auditor` are triggered producing required behavior.
    ```

  </div>

  <div id="#2" className="tabcontent">
    ```js {} showLineNumbers
    // .server/models/Audit.model.js

    import mongoose, { Schema } from 'mongoose'

    export const auditLogSchema = new Schema({
      actorId: String,
      actorEmail: String,
      actorFirstName: String,
      action: String,
      model: String,
      documentId: String,
      data: Map,
      timestamp: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
    })

    export const AuditLog = mongoose.model('AuditLog', auditLogSchema)

    // 1. Nothing fancy here. `AuditLog` is schema definition which'll store metadata
    //    related to each event for auditing.
    ```

  </div>

  <div id="#3" className="tabcontent">
    ```js {} showLineNumbers {7-14, 22}
    // .server/middleware/02.audit.global.js

    let closure = () => {}

    export function captureEvent(val) {
      let event = val
      closure = function () {
        const user = {
          id: event?.user?._id || '1',
          firstName: event?.user?.firstName || 'cleverprogrammer',
          email: event?.user?.email || 'dev@ltran.net',
        }
        return user
      }
      return closure
    }

    export { closure }

    export default defineEventHandler(async (e) => {
      try {
        captureEvent(e)
      } catch (error) {
        logger.error({ err: error }, 'Error:')
      }
    })

    // 1. We define a closure, `captureEvent()`, which wraps `closure()`.
    // 2. When closure() is invoked by a hook it has access to the event object
    //    which was available when captureEvent() was invoked(by our middleware)
    // 3. Thus we now have access to the user making the request within every resource.
    ```

  </div>
  <div id="#4" className="tabcontent">
    ```js {} showLineNumbers {5, 21, 28}
    // .server/models/Audit.js
    import { closure } from '../middleware/02.audit.global.js'

    export class Auditor {
      static async createEntry(modelName, action, user, doc) {
        try {
          const auditLogEntry = await new AuditLog({
            actorId: user.id,
            actorEmail: user.email,
            actorFirstName: user.firstName,
            action,
            model: modelName,
            documentId: doc._id,
          })
          await auditLogEntry.save()
        } catch (error) {
          console.log({ error })
        }
      }

      static createHook(hook) {
        return async function () {
          const user = closure()
          const modelName = this.constructor.modelName
          await Auditor.createEntry(modelName, hook, user, this)
        }
      }
      static addHooks(schema) {
        schema.post('save', this.createHook('create'))
        schema.post('update', this.createHook('update'))
        schema.post('remove', this.createHook('delete'))
      }
    }

    // The logic for auto creating `AuditLog` documents in our DB.
    // We add 3 hooks, save, update, remove which all invoke createHook when those events
    // are detected. The createHook method then invokes the closure which captured the request event.

    // From the event we're able to ascertain the user and then create a document
    // in the `AuditLog` collection with `createEntry`.
    ```

  </div>
</div>

### 10. Trigger Create/Save Hook

By creating an instance of `User` using Mongo when this endpoint is hit we'll trigger our hooks behind the scenes.

```js showLineNumbers {4-8}
// .server/api/index.get.ts

export default defineEventHandler(async () => {
  const user = await new User({
    firstName: 'Loi',
    lastName: 'Tran',
    email: 'dev@ltran.net',
  }).save()
  return {
    wizards: ['Harry', 'Hermione', 'Ron'],
  }
})
```

Test the endpoint with another `curl` request.

```sh
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6ImxvaUBsdHJhbi5uZXQiLCJpYXQiOjE3NDUxMTI1MDAsImV4cCI6MjA2MDQ3MjUwMH0.m66vk-I0HJhJOU9vcz61zrQzI_Mbnr-50P8B-_DQqNo" http://localhost:3001/api
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

Now you should see that each time you hit that endpoint the `auditlog` collection has a new document because the creation of a `User` document triggered
the hooks we defined inside of `Auditor` of `./server/models/Audit.js`.

# Conclusion

With knowledge of middlewares, events, & closures we're able to track the utilization of our system & history of changes
across all resources quickly & easily.

- With hooks we don't duplicate code
- With the `captureEvent` closure we're able to detect the `User` making the request.
  - We **must** define a placeholder function `closure` which is referenced inside of the hooks because it will be passed to Mongo's hook helpers.
  - When `captureEvent` is triggered it overwrites `closure` capturing the event object which contains the details about the user making the request(their token).
  - With this approach we're able to build our resources/schemas up and then eventually use a value which we don't have at build time(requesting user's token/email).

### Dive Deeper: Closure's Usecase Explanation

From examples online we know that a closure is a function which wraps an inner variable
& returns a function which can "see" the wrapped variable.

```js showLineNumbers
function makeAdder(x) {
  return function (y) {
    return x + y
  }
}

const add5 = makeAdder(5)
const add3 = makeAdder(3)

console.log(add5(2)) // 5 + 2 = 7
console.log(add3(2)) // 3 + 2 = 5
```

In this example when we initialize our closure by calling `makeAdder`. We pass it a value which is wrapped meaning we can access it later. We then invoke the returned anonymous function from the closure with a new value which sums with the wrapped variable, producing our result.

The general idea is a function that "remembers" a variable & returns a function which subsequently accesses the initial variable.

However this example is contrived. That's why I built this example auditing project/module because it demonstrates how closures can help to propagate values to places that we need them.

Specifically, when the app is started we create a placeholder function, `closure()` which is fed into each of our system's resources/models. We do so in order to enable lifecycle hooks to access run time values which aren't available when the models are initialized. When `captureEvent` is triggered in our middleware it captures the request `event` containing requester meta data. Then in the event that a save, update or remove to our resource is triggered then the hook invokes the closure which was reassigned to the placeholder `closure()` encapsulating user data in the scope of the function calls.
