summary: 'Building a Duolingo/Quizlet/Leetcode/Tiktok Clone'
---

Duolingo/Quizlet/Leetcode/TikTok are all apps I've used in the past and thought
were kinda cool but cold be improved.

I decided to build an app which will combine elements of all of these apps
into a self improvement platform.

[Semantic Stoic](https://semantic-stoic.web.app/#/)

I know that sounds all over the place, but don't startup founders and VC's always
say we should be ready to pivot depending on product market fit?

In any case, I figured it'd be a nice opportunity to take a break from Leetcode during
my free time.

The MVP is building using Flutter & Firebase.

Here using Google Analytics I've found that four days after launching the site,
we have 110 users from 24 different countries. Yay!
