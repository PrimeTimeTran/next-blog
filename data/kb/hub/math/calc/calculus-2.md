# 📘 Calculus 2 Hub

## 🧠 Core Idea

> Calculus 2 is about turning continuous change into **accumulated quantities and infinite representations**

Everything reduces to:

- summation (finite → infinite)
- approximation (exact → limit)
- transformation (complex → simpler forms)

## 🧠 Purpose

Calculus 2 is the study of **accumulation and infinite processes**.

It explains how we:

- add infinitely many small contributions (integrals)
- analyze infinite sums (series)
- approximate functions using polynomials
- work with curves that aren’t functions of x

# 🧱 1. Integration Fundamentals

> [[Integration]] is accumulation

- [[atom/math/calc/core/integral/definite-integral|definite-integral]] → signed accumulation
  ![[reference/calc/formula/definite-integral|definite-integral]]
- [[indefinite-integral]] → antiderivatives
  ![[indefinite-integral]]
- [[fundamental-theorem-of-calculus]] → link between derivative and integral
  ![[fundamental-theorem-of-calculus-unified-form-core-identity]]
- [[riemann-sum|Riemann Sums]] → definition of the integral as a limit
- [[accumulation|Area as Accumulation]] → geometric interpretation

### ⚙️ Convergence & Divergence Tests 🧪

Every infinite series does exactly one of two things:

- **Converges** → approaches a finite value
- **Diverges** → does not

So every “convergence test” is really:

> a **convergence/divergence test**>

### 🔹 Benchmark Series (memorize these)

- Used by other tests:
  - Comparison Test → _"Does this behave like a p-series?"_
  - Comparison Test → _"Does this behave like a p-series?"_
  - Comparison Test → _"Does this behave like a p-series?"_
- # [[geometric|Geometric Series]]

> [!info]- $\sum ar^n$
>
> - converges if $|r| < 1$
> - diverges if $|r| \ge 1$

- # [[p-series|P-Series]]

> [!info]- $\sum \frac{1}{n^p}$
>
> - converges if $p > 1$
> - diverges if $p \le 1$

### 🔹 Special Types of Series

#### ⚡️ Power Series

> [!info]- ![[power-series]]
>
> - radius of convergence
> - interval of convergence
> - local function representation

It behaves like a **machine that depends on $x$**, and its behavior changes based on where you are relative to $c$.

#### 🧠 Taylor & Maclaurin Series

- [[taylor|Taylor Series]] → power series representing a function

> [!info]- ![[taylor-series]]
>
> - $f^{(n)}(c)$ = $n$th derivative of $f$ evaluated at $c$
> - $n!$ = factorial (scaling factor)
> - $(x - c)^n$ = how far you are from the center

- [[maclaurin|Maclaurin Series]] → Taylor series centered at $x = 0$

> [!info]- ![[taylor-series]]
>
> A Maclaurin series is just a Taylor series centered at $c = 0$:

#### 🔐 Key Idea

Both are:

> infinite polynomials that approximate a function using its derivatives

They work because:

- the function is being “matched” at a point
- slope, curvature, and higher-order behavior are encoded via derivatives

# 🧩 7. Core Mental Model

> Calculus 2 is the study of integration, infinite series, and alternative coordinate systems used to model accumulation and approximation in continuous mathematics.

## 🧠 Three Big Ideas

### 1. Accumulation

Integrals sum infinitely many infinitesimal parts.

### 2. Decomposition

Complex expressions become solvable via transformation.

### 3. Infinite Representation

Functions can be represented as infinite sums.

## 🧠 System View

Calculus 2 is the bridge between:

- finite → infinite
- exact → approximate
- geometric → algebraic
